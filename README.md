# Worst Case Scenario Playbook

This is a work in progress, based upon what I see existing communities using to persevere.

----------

Let's brainstorm how to save as many individuals as possible.

Prioritize strong social bonds.

Figure out what everyone needs, and give it to them. Encourage others to do the same.

People in stable situations may be able to help shelter and protect those who aren't.

Be the most badass version of yourself there is.

When someone needs help, they should call for help. Learn to recognize these.

Prioritize, make compromises, mend damage.

We persist. We rise to the challenges before us. We win.

!=! More to come !=!
